# Tic Tac Duck Hunt

##
- Project created during a Hackathon by students at Learning Fuze.

###
- Follows tic-tac-toe game play (ie alternating players, a number of contiguous cells in a row to win).
- Player-selected gameboard size between 3 - 5.
- Win condition dynamically determined based off board size.
- In place of X's and O's, Ducks will be randomly generated in squares.
	- Shoot ducks to mark a square before the timer runs out
	- Hitting the dog is an instant loss
	- Each duck hit results in 5 - 20 points depending on how quickly it is shot
	- If game results in a tie, highest score wins
